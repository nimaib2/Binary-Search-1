I had done this problem some time ago, the approach I had for this was to simply check each row of the matrix. Then, I would just check if the target was in that row using python's native functionality for checking if a
value is in a list.

class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        for matrice in matrix:
            if target in matrice:
                return True
        return False
