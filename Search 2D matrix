I simply checked every row of the matrix then checked if the target exists in that row by using python's native functionality for checking if a given element exists within a list.

class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        for matrice in matrix:
            if target in matrice:
                return True
        return False
